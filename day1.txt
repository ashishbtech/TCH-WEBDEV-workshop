Network
A network is when two or more computers (or phones, tablets, printers, etc.) are connected so they can talk to each other and share things.
Examples:  Your home Wi-Fi → your phone, laptop, smart TV are all on the same network  
School/office computers connected with cables or Wi-Fi  
Even just two phones connected by Bluetooth = a very small network

Think of it like friends holding hands — they can now pass messages, files, photos to each other.



Internet
The Internet is the very very big network that connects millions of small networks all over the world together.
It’s like one giant spider web made of billions of computers, phones, servers, cables (under the sea, on land), satellites, etc.Simple way to remember:  Network = friends in your house/school/office who can share things  
Internet = all the friends in the whole world connected together (so you can watch YouTube, chat with someone in another country, play online games, etc.)







A protocol is like a common set of rules or a language that computers and devices follow so they can talk to
 each other properly on a network or the internet.Without protocols, devices would be like people speaking 
 completely different languages — they couldn't understand each other, even if connected by wires or Wi-Fi.



TCP vs UDP: Differences between the protocols
The main difference between TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) is that TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly. This makes each protocol suited to different types of data transfers.

Protocols are rules that govern how data is formatted and sent over a network. TCP and UDP are two different methods for doing the same job: transferring data via the internet. They enable servers and devices to communicate so you can send emails, watch Netflix, play games, and browse web pages.

TCP creates a secure communication line to ensure the reliable transmission of all data. Once a message is sent, the receipt is verified to make sure all the data was transferred.

UDP does not establish a connection when sending data. It sends data without confirming receipt or checking for errors. That means some or all of the data may be lost during transmission.

 

TCP is best for:

Email or texting

File transfers

Web browsing

UDP is best for:

Live streaming

Online gaming

Video chat
