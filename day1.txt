Network
A network is when two or more computers (or phones, tablets, printers, etc.) are connected so they can talk to each other and share things.
Examples:  Your home Wi-Fi → your phone, laptop, smart TV are all on the same network  
School/office computers connected with cables or Wi-Fi  
Even just two phones connected by Bluetooth = a very small network

Think of it like friends holding hands — they can now pass messages, files, photos to each other.



Internet
The Internet is the very very big network that connects millions of small networks all over the world together.
It’s like one giant spider web made of billions of computers, phones, servers, cables (under the sea, on land), satellites, etc.Simple way to remember:  Network = friends in your house/school/office who can share things  
Internet = all the friends in the whole world connected together (so you can watch YouTube, chat with someone in another country, play online games, etc.)







A protocol is like a common set of rules or a language that computers and devices follow so they can talk to
 each other properly on a network or the internet.Without protocols, devices would be like people speaking 
 completely different languages — they couldn't understand each other, even if connected by wires or Wi-Fi.
